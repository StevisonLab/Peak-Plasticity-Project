# Abstract
Meiotic recombination rates vary in response to environmental factors like temperature. Increased age also alters recombination rates in a variety of taxa. Recently, heat stress has been shown to reveal plasticity in recombination rates in D. pseudoobscura. Here, both heat stress and maternal age were investigated to determine the peak sensitivity period in this species. Using a combination of molecular genotyping and mutant flies were reared in either control or stress temperatures in a traditional cross design. Using mixed model analysis, the odds of crossover formation was 1.55X higher during days 7-9 (p=0.0017) and 1.41X higher on day 9 (p=0.034) post-mating in high temperature as compared to control crosses, suggesting this time period as the timing of peak plasticity. Time of peak plasticity at day 9 in D. pseudoobscura can be explained by comparison to the model organism D. melanogaster due to similar timing of key meiotic events. This comparative approach will enable future mechanistic work on the duration and the effects of temperature stress on recombination rate. For maternal age, survivorship was investigated to guide the choice of treatment age. Then, a large-scale recombination analysis (N=23,559) was set up using the same three X-linked phenotypic markers. Recombination rate differences in two genomic intervals were measured in females aged to 7 days (control) and 35 days (selected treatment age) prior to mating, with progeny collection continuing for 12 days post-mating in 72 hour timepoints. Results revealed a 3.39% increase in recombination rate due to maternal age (p=0.025), for the first 72 hour time point in one of the two marker intervals. For both genomic intervals, recombination rates were higher in the age treatment for the first time point and lower in later time points of the experiment. Next, these data were used to investigate crossover interference, which decreased with maternal age in the first time point and increased in the last time point. Given the timing differences of these two treatments, these results suggest that the mechanisms responsible for recombination rate plasticity may differ between maternal age and heat stress.


# Data Analysis

The R code used for all statistical analysis and to produce all data figures and model tables is included in the folder ["Scripts"](https://github.com/StevisonLab/Peak-Plasticity-Project/tree/master/Scripts) as an R script divided into each section named after sequential experiments. 

The folder ["raw_data_files"](https://github.com/StevisonLab/Peak-Plasticity-Project/tree/master/raw_data_files) includes the backcrosses, raw phenotyping results, fecundity, and female count data from the mutant screens. A separate csv file with treatment information includes dates and other metadata that would be needed to validate the analysis and conclusions herein. Additionally, a processed and cleaned up data file that includes sums of males and females, as well as crossover counts across each interval per time point, per replicate vial is also included. 
As an example a tutorial from experiment 3 in the manuscript can be found in the ["Experiment3_Tutorial"](https://github.com/StevisonLab/Peak-Plasticity-Project/tree/master/Experiment3_Tutorial) folder with all of the results and figures for Experiment 3.
